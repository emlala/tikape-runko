# Web-application for a smoothie database

Group project for the course Introduction to Databases.

You can view the application here: https://smoothiebar-best.herokuapp.com/
The application is unfortunately only in Finnish.

The scripts for the application can be found under scr/main. The file smoothie.db is the database itself.
The Main folder has two subfolders: the HTML and CSS scripts for the web applcation are located under the resources folder, and the runko folder contains all of the Java scripts.

The application can be used for creating, editing and deleting smoothies in the database. One can view the recipes, ingredients and statistics for the ingredients. 

The front page of the application lists all smoothies in the database, and the side panel contains the navigation.
